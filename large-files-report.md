## Files Near Threshold (1000-1250 lines)

### Monitoring Required:
1. **server/services/common/excel-exporter.service.ts** (1,197 lines)
   - Close to threshold, monitor for growth
   - Consider splitting export formats into separate services

2. **client/src/components/features/analysis/DeepContentAnalysis.tsx** (1,141 lines)
   - Large React component, candidate for breakdown
   - Extract sub-components for different analysis sections

3. **client/src/components/features/analysis/TechnicalTab.tsx** (1,049 lines)
   - Complex UI component
   - Split into focused technical analysis components

## Refactoring Impact Analysis

### Bundle Size Optimization
**Before Breakdown:**
- Largest files: 4,286, 2,781, 2,520, 1,935, 1,593, 1,419, 1,317 lines
- Average large file size: 2,122 lines
- Developer cognitive load: High (complex, multi-responsibility files)

**After Breakdown:**
- Target max file size: 400 lines
- Average file size: 250 lines
- Number of focused files: 35+ (from 7 large files)
- Cognitive load: Low (single-responsibility, focused files)

### Maintainability Metrics
- **Testability**: Each extracted service can be unit tested independently
- **Reusability**: Extracted services can be shared across different features
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different services simultaneously
- **Code Discovery**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Bug Isolation**: Issues can be traced to specific, focused services

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Smaller files require less memory to parse
- **Faster Build Times**: TypeScript compilation is faster with smaller files
- **Better Code Splitting**: Frontend can lazy-load specific analysis components
- **Improved Hot Reload**: Development server reloads faster with smaller files

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain all existing exports through barrel files
- Preserve public API interfaces during refactoring
- Use dependency injection to manage service relationships

### Testing Strategy
- Create comprehensive integration tests before refactoring
- Implement unit tests for each extracted service
- Use contract testing to verify service interactions

### Incremental Migration
- Break down one file at a time to minimize risk
- Validate functionality after each extraction
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of refactored code

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- [ ] Zero files exceed 1250 lines
- [ ] Average file size under 300 lines

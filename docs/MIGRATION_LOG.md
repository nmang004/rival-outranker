### 5. Security Middleware (`server/middleware/security.ts`)

#### Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Custom Rate Limiter**: In-memory implementation
- ✅ **Multiple Rate Limits**:
  - General: 100 requests/15 minutes
  - API: 200 requests/15 minutes
  - Auth: 5 requests/15 minutes
  - Upload: 10 requests/hour

#### Input Validation
- ✅ **Request Sanitization**: XSS protection, script removal
- ✅ **Content-Type Validation**: Ensures proper request formats
- ✅ **Request Size Limits**: 50MB maximum for file uploads
- ✅ **User Agent Filtering**: Bot detection and blocking

#### Additional Security
- ✅ **IP Filtering**: Whitelist/blacklist support
- ✅ **Request Logging**: Comprehensive request tracking
- ✅ **Security Headers**: Full CSP, referrer policy, permissions policy

### 6. Environment Variables Configuration

#### Production Environment
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=[Automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL addon]
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-app.railway.app
```

#### Required API Keys
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
DATAFORSEO_API_LOGIN=your-dataforseo-login
DATAFORSEO_API_PASSWORD=your-dataforseo-password
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

## Removed Replit Dependencies

### Code Patterns Eliminated
1. ❌ **Replit Database**: All references to `@replit/database` removed
2. ❌ **Replit Vite Plugins**: Development plugins removed from package.json
3. ❌ **Replit-specific Environment Variables**: Replaced with standard alternatives
4. ❌ **File System Assumptions**: Replaced with database storage where appropriate

### Authentication Updates
- ✅ **JWT-based Authentication**: Maintained existing Passport.js implementation
- ✅ **Session Management**: Using connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- ✅ **Production Security**: Enhanced with proper secret management

## Deployment Process

### Manual Steps Required
1. **Railway Account Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway init
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   railway add --database postgres
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
   railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   # ... additional variables
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

5. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   railway run npm run db:push
   ```

## Testing and Validation

### Health Checks
- ✅ `/health` endpoint responds with comprehensive status
- ✅ Database connectivity verified

## Post-Migration Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Test health check endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Verify database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Test authentication flows end-to-end
- [ ] Validate CORS settings with frontend domain
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Verify API rate limiting works

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Railway metrics monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation if needed
- [ ] Set up external uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure error alerting

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Monitor database connection pool usage
- [ ] Optimize memory usage patterns
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limits based on usage
- [ ] Consider Redis for session storage if high traffic

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Pool
- **Issue**: Connection pool exhaustion under high load
- **Solution**: Configured 20 max connections with proper timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoint shows pool status

### CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Wildcard domains for Railway subdomains
- **Solution**: Implemented pattern matching for *.railway.app domains
- **Testing**: Verify frontend can access API endpoints

### Memory Usage
- **Issue**: Node.js memory leaks in long-running processes
- **Solution**: Implemented graceful shutdown and memory monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoint reports memory usage

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback involves:
1. Revert to previous git commit
2. Redeploy to Railway
3. Restore database from Railway automatic backups
4. Update DNS if custom domain was changed

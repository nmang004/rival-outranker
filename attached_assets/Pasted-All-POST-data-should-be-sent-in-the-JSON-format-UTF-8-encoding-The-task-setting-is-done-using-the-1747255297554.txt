All POST data should be sent in the JSON format (UTF-8 encoding). The task setting is done using the POST method. When setting a task, you should send all task parameters in the task array of the generic POST array. You can send up to 2000 API calls per minute, with each POST call containing no more than 100 tasks. If your POST call contains over 100 tasks, the tasks over this limit will return the 40006 error. Visit DataForSEO Help Center to get practical tips for request handling depending on your SERP API payload volume.

You can retrieve the results of completed tasks using the unique task identifier id. Alternatively, we can send them to you as soon as they are ready if you specify the postback_url or pingback_url when setting a task. Note that if your server doesn’t respond within 10 seconds, the connection will be aborted by timeout, and the task will be transferred to the ‘Tasks Ready’ list. The error code and message depend on your server’s configuration.

See Help Center to learn more about using pingbacks and postbacks with DataForSEO APIs.

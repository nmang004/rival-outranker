# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server with hot reload (Vite frontend + Express backend)
npm run build      # Build production assets (frontend + backend compilation)
npm start          # Start production server
npm run check      # TypeScript type checking across entire codebase
npm run db:push    # Push database schema changes to PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM)
```

### Security Commands
```bash
npm run security:audit     # Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm run security:test      # Run comprehensive security tests
npm run security:headers   # Test security headers implementation
npm run security:fix       # Fix known security vulnerabilities
npm run security:deps      # Check for outdated dependencies
```

### Development Workflow
- Development server runs both frontend (Vite on client/) and backend (Express on server/) concurrently
- Frontend builds to `dist/public/` directory
- Backend uses ESBuild for TypeScript compilation
- Database migrations handled via Drizzle Kit

## Architecture Overview

Rival Outranker is a full-stack SEO analysis platform with a React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database.

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with separate client/server directories sharing types via `shared/schema.ts`

**API Design**: RESTful Express.js API with optional authentication - many endpoints work without login for public access, authenticated endpoints provide enhanced features and history tracking

**Database Pattern**: Drizzle ORM with Zod validation schemas that serve dual purpose:
- Runtime validation for API endpoints
- Type generation for TypeScript interfaces
- Database schema definition

**State Management**: TanStack Query on frontend for server state caching, no global client state management

**Authentication**: Enhanced JWT-based authentication system:
- JWT access tokens (15-minute expiry) with refresh tokens (7-day expiry)
- Password strength validation and bcrypt hashing (12 salt rounds)
- Account lockout protection (5 attempts, 30-minute lockout)
- Session management with device fingerprinting
- Two-factor authentication support
- Real-time security event monitoring

**Security**: Production-grade security implementation:
- Comprehensive input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection with whitelist-based HTML sanitization
- Advanced rate limiting with IP reputation management
- CSRF protection with secure token generation
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- DDoS mitigation with progressive penalties
- Request fingerprinting for fraud detection

### Core Service Architecture

**Layered Architecture**: The application follows a clean layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Controllers** (`server/controllers/`): Handle HTTP requests/responses only
- **Services** (`server/services/`): Contain business logic, organized by domain
- **Repositories** (`server/repositories/`): Handle data access abstraction
- **Models/Schemas** (`shared/schema.ts`): Define data structures and validation

**Analysis Engine (`server/services/analysis/analyzer.service.ts`)**: Central SEO analysis orchestrator that coordinates multiple specialized analyzers:
- Fetches website content via Cheerio
- Runs parallel analysis modules (keyword, meta, content, technical)
- Aggregates results into unified score and recommendations

**Rival Audit System (`server/services/audit/rival-audit-crawler.service.ts`)**: Sophisticated website crawler for professional audits:
- Multi-page crawling with intelligent page type detection
- Real-time progress updates via server-sent events pattern
- Excel/CSV export generation for client delivery

**AI Integration (`server/services/analysis/content-analyzer.service.ts`)**: OpenAI-powered content analysis:
- Section-by-section content evaluation
- GPT-generated improvement recommendations
- Fallback to rule-based analysis when API unavailable

**External API Services** (`server/services/external/`): All external API calls wrapped in organized service classes:
- OpenAI, DataForSEO, Google APIs, PageSpeed services
- Usage tracking and cost estimation
- Automatic fallback to sample data when APIs fail
- Rate limiting and error handling

### Frontend Architecture

**Feature-Based Component Organization**:
- `components/ui/` - Radix UI-based design system components
- `components/features/analysis/` - SEO analysis result displays
- `components/features/audit/` - Professional audit dashboard
- `components/features/keywords/` - Keyword research and rank tracking
- `components/features/backlinks/` - Backlink analysis components
- `components/features/learning/` - Educational content system
- `components/features/auth/` - Authentication components

**Organized Hooks Structure**:
- `hooks/api/` - API interaction hooks
- `hooks/auth/` - Authentication hooks
- `hooks/ui/` - UI state and interaction hooks

**Page-Level Components**: Each major feature has dedicated page component in `pages/` that orchestrates multiple sub-components

**Data Flow**: API calls via React Query ‚Üí cached results ‚Üí component props ‚Üí UI updates

### Database Design Patterns

**User-Centric**: Most tables link to `users.id` for multi-tenant data isolation

**Analysis Storage**: SEO results stored as JSONB in `analyses.results` with Zod schema validation

**Progress Tracking**: Separate tables for user learning progress, keyword rankings, backlink history

**API Usage Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking table for all external API calls with cost estimation

### External API Integration Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**: Application functions with core features even when external APIs are unavailable

**Sample Data Fallbacks**: Realistic sample responses for development and when APIs fail

**Usage Tracking**: All API calls logged with metadata for cost monitoring and optimization

### Key Implementation Details

**File Upload Handling**: 50MB limit for PDF uploads, client-side OCR processing with Tesseract.js

**Real-time Updates**: Server-sent events for long-running analysis tasks (rival audits, deep content analysis)

**Export System**: Multiple export formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with jsPDF and ExcelJS libraries

**Learning System**: Gamified educational content with achievement tracking and sound effects

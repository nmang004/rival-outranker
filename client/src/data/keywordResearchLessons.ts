    content: `<h2>Competitive Keyword Analysis</h2>
      <p>Competitive keyword analysis is the process of examining your competitors' keyword strategies to identify opportunities, gaps, and insights that can strengthen your own SEO approach. By understanding what keywords your competitors are targeting and how effectively they're ranking, you can make more informed decisions about your own keyword priorities.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Competitive Keyword Analysis Matters</h3>
      <p>Analyzing your competitors' keyword strategies offers several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find Overlooked Opportunities:</strong> Discover valuable keywords your competitors rank for that you're missing</li>
        <li><strong>Identify Low-Hanging Fruit:</strong> Find keywords with high potential but lower competition</li>
        <li><strong>Benchmark Performance:</strong> Understand how your keyword rankings compare to competitors</li>
        <li><strong>Uncover Content Gaps:</strong> Identify topics and themes you haven't covered but should</li>
        <li><strong>Save Time:</strong> Learn from competitors' successes and failures rather than starting from scratch</li>
        <li><strong>Refine Your Strategy:</strong> Make data-driven decisions about where to focus your SEO efforts</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Identifying Your True Search Competitors</h3>
      <p>Your search competitors may differ from your business competitors. To identify who you're truly competing against in search results:</p>
      
      <h4>Method 1: Keyword Overlap Analysis</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify your top 20-30 target keywords</li>
        <li>Search for each and note which domains consistently appear</li>
        <li>Track frequency of appearance to identify your main search competitors</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Method 2: Using Competitive Analysis Tools</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your domain into tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz</li>
        <li>View the "Competing Domains" or similar report</li>
        <li>Analyze domains with the highest keyword overlap with yours</li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class="example-box" style="background: #f8f8f8; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Example: Search Competitors vs. Business Competitors</h4>
        <p>A local bakery might consider other nearby bakeries as business competitors. However, in search, they might be competing with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recipe websites (for "sourdough bread recipe")</li>
          <li>Food bloggers (for "best bakeries in [city]")</li>
          <li>Wedding planning sites (for "wedding cake bakery")</li>
          <li>National chains with local pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These search competitors might not be direct business rivals but compete for the same search visibility.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Competitor Keyword Research Process</h3>
      <p>Follow these steps to conduct a thorough competitive keyword analysis:</p>
      
      <h4>Step 1: Create a Competitor List</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify 5-10 main search competitors</li>
        <li>Include both direct business competitors and search-only competitors</li>
        <li>Consider competitors at different levels:
          <ul>
            <li>Aspirational competitors (larger, more established)</li>
            <li>Direct competitors (similar size and offering)</li>
            <li>Emerging competitors (smaller but growing)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Step 2: Analyze Competitor Keyword Profiles</h4>
      <p>For each competitor, gather the following data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top Organic Keywords:</strong> What they rank for by volume</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword Position Distribution:</strong> How many keywords they have in top 3, 4-10, 11-20, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Most Valuable Keywords:</strong> Terms driving the most traffic or with highest commercial intent</li>
        <li><strong>Featured Snippet Ownership:</strong> Keywords where they've captured position zero</li>
        <li><strong>SERP Feature Presence:</strong> Where they appear in image packs, video results, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="tools-box" style="background: #f0f7ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #3366cc;">Tools for Competitor Keyword Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ahrefs:</strong> Site Explorer → Organic Keywords report</li>
          <li><strong>SEMrush:</strong> Domain Analytics → Organic Research</li>
          <li><strong>Moz:</strong> Keyword Explorer → Ranking Keywords</li>
          <li><strong>SpyFu:</strong> Competitor research and keyword overlap</li>
          <li><strong>SimilarWeb:</strong> Traffic sources and keyword insights</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Step 3: Conduct Content Gap Analysis</h4>
      <p>Find keywords that multiple competitors rank for but you don't:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use tools with content gap functionality (Ahrefs, SEMrush)</li>
        <li>Input your domain and 3-5 competitor domains</li>
        <li>Identify keywords that competitors rank for but you don't</li>
        <li>Filter results by relevance, volume, and difficulty</li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class="image-placeholder" style="background: #f0f7ff; border: 1px dashed #3366cc; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <p><strong>Content Gap Analysis Visualization</strong></p>
        <p>A Venn diagram showing overlapping keywords between competitors and highlighting gaps in your coverage</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Step 4: Analyze Competitor Content</h4>
      <p>For top-performing competitor keywords, examine their ranking content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content Structure:</strong> How is the information organized?</li>
        <li><strong>Content Depth:</strong> How comprehensive is their coverage?</li>
        <li><strong>Word Count:</strong> How long are their ranking pages?</li>
        <li><strong>Media Usage:</strong> How do they incorporate images, videos, etc.?</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword Placement:</strong> Where and how do they use target keywords?</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Linking:</strong> How do they connect related content?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Step 5: Identify Keyword Opportunities</h4>
      <p>Based on your analysis, categorize keywords into opportunity types:</p>
      
      <div class="opportunity-table" style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <table border="1" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
          <tr style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">
            <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left;">Opportunity Type</th>
            <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left;">Description</th>
            <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left;">How to Identify</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>Quick Wins</strong></td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Keywords where you're ranking on page 2-3 and could easily move up</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Check your rankings in positions 11-30 for relevant terms with decent volume</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>Content Gaps</strong></td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Topics competitors cover that you don't</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Use content gap analysis tools or manually review competitor content topics</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>Weak Competitor Rankings</strong></td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Keywords where competitors rank but with weak content</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Analyze the quality of competitor content for their ranking keywords</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>Untapped Niches</strong></td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Keyword clusters with relevant traffic but little competition</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Look for related keywords with decent volume but lower difficulty</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>SERP Feature Opportunities</strong></td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Chances to win featured snippets, image packs, etc.</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">Identify keywords triggering SERP features where your content could be optimized</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Step 6: Prioritize and Plan</h4>
      <p>Create an action plan based on your analysis:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prioritize keywords based on:
          <ul>
            <li>Business value (conversion potential)</li>
            <li>Effort required vs. potential return</li>
            <li>Alignment with your content strategy</li>
            <li>Current ranking position (if any)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Develop a content calendar for new content needs</li>
        <li>Create a plan for optimizing existing content</li>
        <li>Set measurable goals for ranking improvements</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Advanced Competitive Analysis Techniques</h3>
      
      <h4>Historical Ranking Analysis</h4>
      <p>Examine how competitor rankings have changed over time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify keywords where competitors have gained or lost positions</li>
        <li>Look for patterns in their content updates or strategy shifts</li>
        <li>Determine if ranking changes correlate with algorithm updates</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Share of Voice Analysis</h4>
      <p>Measure your search visibility compared to competitors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculate the percentage of clicks you capture for target keywords</li>
        <li>Track changes in share of voice over time</li>
        <li>Set goals for increasing your share of relevant searches</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="formula-box" style="background: #f0f7ff; border: 1px solid #3366cc; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; text-align: center;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Share of Voice Formula</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Share of Voice = (Your Visibility Score / Total Visibility Score of All Competitors) × 100%</p>
        <p><em>Visibility Score = Sum of (Search Volume × CTR for Position) for all keywords</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>SERP Feature Opportunity Analysis</h4>
      <p>Identify SERP features your competitors are capturing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Featured snippets (position zero)</li>
        <li>Image packs and video carousels</li>
        <li>People Also Ask boxes</li>
        <li>Local pack results</li>
        <li>Site links and other enhanced results</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For each feature, analyze what content and structural elements help competitors win these positions.</p>
      
      <div class="tip-box" style="background: #f5fff5; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #4caf50;">Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>To win featured snippets, look for keywords with "what is," "how to," or "why" modifiers where competitors currently own the snippet. Then create content that directly answers the question more concisely and comprehensively than the current snippet holder.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Competitive Link Analysis for Keywords</h4>
      <p>Examine the backlink profile supporting competitor keyword rankings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify top referring domains sending traffic to competing pages</li>
        <li>Analyze anchor text distribution for target keywords</li>
        <li>Find link opportunities by reaching out to sites linking to competitors</li>
        <li>Determine if link quality or quantity is the primary ranking factor</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Interpreting Competitive Keyword Data</h3>
      <p>Look for these patterns when analyzing competitor keyword data:</p>
      
      <h4>Keyword Clustering Patterns</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Do competitors focus on specific keyword themes?</li>
        <li>How do they organize related keywords across their site architecture?</li>
        <li>Are there distinct content silos evident in their keyword targeting?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Content Format Preferences</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Which content types rank best for different keyword categories?</li>
        <li>Do competitors favor guides, listicles, case studies, or other formats?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between content format and ranking position?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Seasonal or Trending Keyword Adaptation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>How do competitors adjust their targeting for seasonal keywords?</li>
        <li>Do they quickly adapt to emerging trends and search terms?</li>
        <li>Is there a strategy for maintaining evergreen vs. trending content?</li>
      </ul>
